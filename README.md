LANDING PAGE:

A landing page is a standalone web page that a visitor "lands" on after clicking a link in an email, ad, or anywhere else on the web. Landing pages are designed to convert visitors into leads, signups, or sales. They are different from homepages and other web pages in that they are focused on one goal and are disconnected from a website's navigation.
Landing pages are created for a browsing experience and showcase multiple offers. They are designed to captivate, engage, and drive action. They can be used in many different marketing campaigns, including: Paid search campaigns, Paid social media advertising campaigns, and Email campaigns.

There are many different types of landing pages, including:
-->Lead generation landing pages
These pages use a form to collect lead data, like names and email addresses.
-->Squeeze pages
These pages are also known as "lead capture pages" or "destination pages". Their only goal is to gather email addresses to add potential leads to a general mailing list. They are short, basic landing pages with bold headlines and minimal content.
-->Product landing pages
These pages are used to communicate the features, images, colors, sizes, and price of physical products or digital products (such as ebooks or online courses).
A good landing page typically includes a compelling headline, a persuasive subheading with a clear value proposition, and an obvious call to action (CTA). Depending on the goal of the campaign, it can also include a striking hero image or video, social proof in the form of customer testimonials and reviews![Screenshot (5)](https://github.com/KomalGupta001/OCTANET_APRIL/assets/88608898/db09d18e-49f9-4474-94b3-a46c595379aa)
